# KE-complex_modifications

complex_modifications for Karabiner-Elements.

<https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/>

## Add rules

1.  Put a `.erb` template file to [src/json](https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications/tree/master/src/json). (Or put a `.json` file to [docs/json](https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications/tree/master/docs/json) directly.)
2.  (Optional) Put extra description to [docs/extra_descriptions](https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications/tree/master/docs/extra_descriptions).
3.  Add the following json into [docs/groups.json](https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications/tree/master/docs/groups.json) &gt; `files`.

    ```json
    {
      "path": "json/your_awesome.json"
    },
    ```

4.  Run `make` command on Terminal in order to make `docs/json/your_awesome.json` if you put source file into `src/json`.

    ```shell
    make
    ```

### Note

`docs/index.html` does not work properly if you open it via `file://...`.<br />
Launch a local web server by `make server` in terminal and open <http://localhost:8000>.<br />
(You can quit the local web server by the `control-c` shortcut in terminal.)

Karabiner-Elements cannot import the json from the local web server due to the no https connection between local web server.<br />
Please import the json via file copy. (See Local testing section.)

## Local testing

1.  Copy a json file to `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`.
2.  Import rules from Karabiner-Elements Preferences.

### Example

```shell
cp docs/json/caps_lock.json ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications
```

Then open `Karabiner-Elements Preferences > Complex Modifications > Rules > Add rule`

## Publish your own forked page

If you want to publish your own forked page, please commit `docs/dist.json` to repository. (`dist.json` will be generated by `make` command)

The `dist.json` is ignored by .gitignore in order to avoid file conflicting because the file is editted by multiple users in the main repository.

# Karabiner-Elements Usage

## Import file from another site

1.  Put a json file to your site.
2.  Make a link `karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=<JSON_URL>`.
3.  Open the link from web browser.

# Updating the web application

Note: You don't need to update the web application if you just want to add new json.

If you want to modify the web application, the source code is in `src/vuejs`.
Follow the instruction in `src/vuejs/README.md`.
