<h2>Swiss PC-Like Shortcuts</h2>
<p>

  You may notice that the keys <strong>"grave_accent_and_tilde" and "non_us_backslash"
  have been switched</strong>.
  <br>
  This behaviour was not intended, you can <strong>fix it with a simple modification</strong> between
  these two keys.
  <br>
  The "AltGr-<" wasn't implemented because it didn't output the expected key
